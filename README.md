We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our earlier decision to temporarily exclude Binance and Coinbase exchanges from our platform. We deeply appreciate your patience and understanding during this period.

## Reasons for Temporary Exclusion

The temporary exclusion of Binance and Coinbase exchanges from our supported list is due to several factors, with one of the main considerations being the increased regulatory scrutiny both exchanges have faced in recent months. This regulatory environment has posed challenges in effectively integrating with these platforms.

## Our Forward Outlook

We want to assure our users that we remain committed to providing a seamless trading experience. While we are actively working to restore support for Binance and Coinbase exchanges, we are unable to provide a specific timeline for the reintegration of these platforms.

## Your Ongoing Support

Your understanding and support have been invaluable to us as we navigate through this period of adjustment. We are dedicated to exploring all possibilities to enhance our services and reintroduce complete access to all exchanges. Timely updates will be shared as we make progress in this endeavor.

Thank you for being part of the TradingBotX community.

Best regards,  
Team TradingBotX
