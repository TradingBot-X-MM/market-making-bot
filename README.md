## Important Notice: Temporary Exclusion of Binance and Coinbase Exchanges

We regret to inform our users that as of now, we are unable to offer support for trading on the Binance and Coinbase exchanges. We understand the inconvenience this might cause and sincerely apologize for any disruption this decision may have caused.

## Reasons for the Decision

This decision is influenced by several factors. Notably, both Binance and Coinbase have faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months, resulting in complications during the integration process with our platform.

## Our Commitment

We want to emphasize our unwavering commitment to delivering a seamless trading experience. While we deeply regret this temporary limitation, our team is actively working to reinstate support for Binance and Coinbase exchanges in the foreseeable future. However, please note that we are unable to provide a specific timeline for the restoration of services on these platforms.

## Your Understanding Matters

We greatly appreciate your understanding during this transitional phase. Our team is dedicated to exploring every avenue to enhance our services and reestablish complete access to the exchanges that our users rely on. We will ensure prompt updates as we make progress in this endeavor.

Thank you for your continued support and patience.

Best regards,  
Team TradingBotX
